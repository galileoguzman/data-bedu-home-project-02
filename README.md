# Solution for home project


This repository stores the solution for the home project given to the students of my Python Foundamentals for Data Analysis at Bedu.


### Requirements

To run the code in this repository you shall create a virtual environment with `Python` native `venv` module.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Do not forget activate your `virtual environment` with:

For Mac and Linux.
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

For windows systems.
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then you will need install the requirements of your project:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the project

We are using different technologies wrapped in a virtual environment, to run this project you only need to open our notebooks.

```
jupyter notebook
```
